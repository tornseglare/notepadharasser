# notepadharasser
One project to record what you write with your timing between letters and save as a file. The other project takes the file and write it out to notepad.

# Create your file
1. Run the KeyboardReader2 project.
2. Enter the line or lines you want to. Enter works, as well as erasing characters. Swedish åäö and ÅÄÖ is "working" too. :-P
3. When you write '+' the program save your stuff into a file named result.json and exits.

# Enjoy the result
1. Copy the result.json file from the KeyboardReader2 project to the NotepadHarasser project. (Found in the debug folder)
2. Run  KeyboardReader2 project.
3. Now notepad should start and your writing materialize.
